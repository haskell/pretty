-- Tests and benchmarks do not build due to cycling package dependencies.
-- QuickCheck/containers -> template-haskell -> pretty.
-- Building the benchmarks requires template-haskell which depends on pretty
-- causing a dependency cycle that cabal cannot handle.

-- Since GHC 9.8, containers depend also on template-haskell so building
-- the testsuite is broken as well there.
